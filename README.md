# Amateur Contesting Standard

An Amateur Radio shared open contesting standard that can serve contest organisers, contest software developers and contest participants.

## Reason

Amateur Radio contesting is extremely popular and valuable for training and skill development. Contests rules are managed by organisers who often rely on external developers to implement the rules in contesting software for contest participants to use. In addition, scoring is managed separately from this process by the organisers who do this manually, rely on someone else's software, or if the contest is popular enough, write their own code to manage the process.

All this effort creates a disconnect between the contester, the organiser and the contest software developers, each using their own definition of the rules of any particular contest.

When the rules change, all parties are required to revisit their implementation.

## Discussion and Collaboration

This is intended to be an open shared standard for contest definition. It can only succeed if the process is owned by the entire contesting community and as such the discussion will happen in public, using the [Wiki](https://github.com/vk6flab/amateur-contesting-standard/wiki) and other tools as required by the community.

## Licenssing

This effort must be a shared resource for all participants. The MIT license was chosen to remove any limits, but that does not mean that this is a final choice, it's there as a starting point.
